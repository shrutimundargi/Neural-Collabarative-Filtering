# Neural Collabarative Filtering

## YouTube Ranking using the MovieLens dataset

The YouTube ranking algorithm implemented in the Libre Recommender library is inspired by the recommendation system used by YouTube, the popular video-sharing platform. This algorithm is designed to effectively recommend items to users based on their preferences and behaviors, with a focus on user engagement and satisfaction.

The key features of the YouTube ranking algorithm typically include:

Collaborative Filtering: The algorithm leverages user-item interactions to make personalized recommendations. It considers factors such as user ratings, views, likes, and dislikes to understand user preferences.

Temporal Dynamics: The algorithm takes into account the temporal aspects of user behavior, such as recency and frequency of interactions. This allows it to adapt to changing user preferences over time.

Content-Based Filtering: In addition to collaborative filtering, the algorithm may also incorporate content-based features such as item metadata (e.g., video titles, descriptions, tags) to enhance recommendation accuracy.

Diversity and Serendipity: The algorithm aims to provide diverse and serendipitous recommendations to users, ensuring a balanced mix of popular and niche content to cater to a wide range of preferences.

Scalability: The algorithm is designed to handle large-scale datasets efficiently, making it suitable for real-world applications with millions of users and items.

Overall, the YouTube ranking algorithm in Libre Recommender is a versatile and effective tool for building recommendation systems that prioritize user satisfaction and engagement. It offers a flexible framework for experimentation and customization, allowing developers to tailor the algorithm to specific use cases and datasets.
